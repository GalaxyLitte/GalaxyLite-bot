## 🎭 Legendary Moments

### 🔥 **The "7 Commands" Beginning**

# The humble start (15.12.2025):
commands = ["!кик", "!бан", "!очистить", "!мут", 
"!размут", "!добавить", "!убрать", "!сбросить"]

# V1.0 Pro's famous embed:
"👑 СОЗДАТЕЛЬ GALAXYLITE V1.0 PRO"
"retre_helis - добрый и отзывчивый человек..."
"(но иногда он злится но все равно милашка)"  # Real talk!

🎵 First Music Module Attempt
The ambitious but buggy V2.0 Pro music system that never quite worked right.

🛠️ Technical Architecture
📁 Multi-Server Database System

# Each server gets its own isolated database:
databases/
├── 123456789.db    # Server 1
├── 987654321.db    # Server 2
└── ...

V3.0: Actual pattern learning and behavior analysis

📊 Statistics
